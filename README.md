# PomfCrypt

PomfCrypt is a crypto-project that encrypts uploaded files and tries to be reasonably secure.
Due to the fact that files are encrypted on the server and not client-side, security questions arise by-design. Therefore it would be smart to only upload files to a trusted server.

## About

I implemented this project a few years ago to learn [Go](https://golang.org). For my A levels I have the chance to submit a project in a subject of my choice (computer science, in my case) and have it graded as an additional subject for the final grade. I chose this project, because it is easy to understand and trivial to implement. Additionally, it is very easy to write a lot about cryptography and the implementation hereof.

## Project structure

This project will consist of 3 repositories: [This meta repository](https://github.com/pomfcrypt/pomfcrypt), [a backend repository](https://github.com/pomfcrypt/pomfcrypt-backend) and [a frontend repository](https://github.com/pomfcrypt/pomfcrypt-frontend).

## Technology stack

The backend is written in [Golang](https://golang.org). I chose Golang due to the amazing performance and security it provides.

## Documentation

The documentation will be written in LaTeX and can be found in this repository under the `docs` folder.
